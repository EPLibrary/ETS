gtfsrealtime notes

Step
1.	Get all the tripids out of the regular schedule page somehow
2.	Request from some coldfusion page that then runs cfexecute on the gtfsrealtime parser thing I made
3.	loop through the elements and insert any relevant data into the page.

Sigh. I've got my work cut out for me.	


112, 7, 8 are taking lots of detours




- replace the displayed time and datetime fields
- the time calculation should automatically update
- if the schedule relationship is SKIPPED, show SKIPPED in lieu of time (make sure the ETA doesn't show anything)
- If the bus is late or early, show this status in the hidden row
- change the class of the field to reflect late or early, and I will style it differently to reflect this
